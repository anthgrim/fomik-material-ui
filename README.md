# Sign Up Form: React, Formik, Material UI and Yup
Extra coding challenge from MIT Full Stack Development with MERN. 

It consists in taking one of the examples from the Formik boiler plates and experiment with it. I personally wanted to work with Material UI since it's very popular among the dev community. As well, the package Yup for the validation schemas, this allow me to build validations pretty quick.

## Goals
To create a simple sign up form using different libraries.
